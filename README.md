# Geo-Trex
Geospatial supported T-Rex complex event processing engine

**Geo-T-Rex** is an extension of the T-Rex Complex Event Processing (CEP) engine that adds support for geo-spatial attributes and operations. This allows for real-time processing of geospatial data streams.

## Features
- Geo-spatial event processing
- Integration with existing T-Rex CEP
- Supports geospatial attributes such as coordinates, distances, and areas
- Simulation data for testing

## Requirements
- Java 8+
- Maven

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BehnamKhazael/Geo-T-Rex.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder and run Maven:
   ```bash
   cd Geo-T-Rex
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Usage
- To run the simulation, execute:
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java
   ```
